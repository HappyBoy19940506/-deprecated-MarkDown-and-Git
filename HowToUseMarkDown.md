Hi see you again guys, this is happyboy's **One-page 4 One-day** tutorial for first-leaner of Markdown and we gonna use the Typora for its **editor**. If you find it remarkable and useful, feel free to compliment me on github link.

# What is it?

## Markdown

uhmm, it is just a way that you type words in your computer. Whether you've wonder why people's  **readme.md** looks so tidy on their github files. And its kinda weird as they look like all follow exactly the same appearance and structure. For example, the reference part - the same coloraturas,  the text part--the font size and colour. Why? because they all use the Markdown to wrtie things. Goddamn it. Since recently, i got the truth. I thought they were all well-trained in a same place.

## Typora

OK, **Markdown** is like a way to write, so we need a software to work on with. This is **Typora**. 

Relationship: Markdown > Typora ----  Way we go work > Metro



# Why we use it?

## Simply and Cool

For many years, I've just use the Microsoft Office or Pages stuff like that. To be honest, I think they are pretty potent. Even now, I still think the font issues like the size and **bold** and *italic*  or ***italic*** are much simpler to be addressed on Microsoft and Pages. Just *Control + B* is enough, easier than use **\**  ****.However, things changed when i want to write an essay.

The matter is prargraph. the space issues and the build up the outline architecuture is catastrophic.

But when you get used to Markdown, it becomes easy like eating chips. You will definetely find what I'm trying to say when you start to Markdown an article, just like this page. :happy:

By the way, it is so compatible for HTML. Born for display in HTML pages! 

# How to use it?

there are couples of sparking points, and you can go check on their website for guidlines on <https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/>



## Structure

First, lets talk about how we change the text and fonts when we write.Correctly speaking, we cannot change fonts.Because it was born simply for reading ,not displaying.  We can only change the font by a direct and assigned,specific way to make browsing clear and right away. e.g. if we use #heading, the words "heading" becomes a heading with a fixed font size.

### Heading levels



- different headling levels

  1. Heading level 1:  use #+space+What You Write (the Biggest one)

     > # I am the biggest noob

  2.  Heading level 2: use ##+space+What You Write (the smaller one)

     > ## I am a smaller noob

  3.  Heading level 3:use ##+space+What You Write (the smallest one)

     > ### i am the smallest noob

  4.  then heading is over, go for your content:

     > i am a real noob.

- **important !**

  - This is very important bro. The difference between text and paragraph is that you must put the **signs** with a ***space*** before the content. i.e. *use #+**space**+What You Write*. If not, it wont work. Remember, add one space !!!!

  > :+1:: ### wo shi shabi 
  >
  > :-1::###wo shi sha bi 

  - It is not recommend that you let the heading sticks with your surrounding paragraphs for compatibility issues.

    That is to say:

    >:+1::  i am a noob
    >
    > 
    >
    >​		#i am a heading
    >
    >
    >
    >​		i am a noob
    >
    >:-1:: i am a noob
    >
    >​		#i am a heading
    >
    >​		i am a noob

  - Cheeeeeeeeeeers XD 



### Lists

+ use the sign + or - * to generate a un-ordered list

  >* 
  >
  >+ 

+ use the sign of "1." and "2." "3." to generate a ordered-list

  > 1. aaaa
  > 2. bbbb
  > 3. ccccc

+ mixed use for complex siutation:

  > -  apple
  >   1. aaa
  >   2. bbb
  > - blue
  >   1. good
  >   2. bad

+ ***Important:* ** This one is pretty much like the heading levels, because they all belong to the strucuture parts. which means:

  > ***They all need a space when you use the sign before the content!!!! :exclamation:***

  

  - how to fullfill this?

    > #### The quarterly results look great!
    >
    > - Revenue was off the chart.
    > - Profits were higher than ever.
    >
    > *Everything* is going according to **plan**.

  

## Paragraph



### Things about spaces



+  paragraph is the content that we need, so just write what we need. Dont have to put anything like **<p>** in HTML 

+ Dont put any space in the beginning of each paragraph.

  >:+1:: Gtg m8
  >
  >:-1::[space]Gtg m8

+ **if you want strat a new line, remember type two or more spaces at the end of last line, then type "return" **

  > Example :kiss: :  i am noob [space] [space] [space]
  >
  > ​						  you are a noob too.

+ ***In conclusion:***

  > [no space] I am a noob. \[space]\[space]\[space]
  >
  > [no space] I am aaaaaa. \[space]\[space]\[space]

## Text

### Emphasis--bold/italic/so on

+ EASY. Use the **signs** :**\**	**** to get the words surrounded.

  then you can get:

  > \**  wow  **  ----->  **wow**

+ :exclamation:**vert important**:   

  **you must let the words stick tightly with the \** 	\**,and there is no space (no like the # in headings)! **

+  :exclamation::**notice and practise**

  >how to type **\**words\*\* ** with bold ? i.e.   type ** with bold.
  >
  >answer: **words ** by using backslash \
  >
  >**\** \** words\** \****

+ EASY. Use \* words\*  to make it italic. same ingrident.

+ ESAY. Use \*\*\* word\*\*\* to make words italic and bold.

  

### Blockquotes 

- this is very frequently used in daily use. especially for code quote or other quote.

> please use" > "sign to do it :kiss:

- if you want to do more than one line:

>\>
>
>\>

- if you want to do a nested one:

>> \>\>
>>
>>\>

+ **Blockquotes** with other elements

  - a

  - b

    >ccc

  - d

### Code and CodeBlocks

+ ***code***

  -  warp the code within backticks ***`*** ,and you can get sth cool.

    > `javascript`
    >
    > python --without `
    >
    > `python`-- with `

  - rememerb, it is a text effect, so ***no space before the words***

  - ***if you want denote somthing who has backticks but it is in the code , you can use the double backticks***, you can do this:

    > 1. `` haha, what``     --- nomarl, use \` words\`
    >
    > 2. `` This is a `code`,right? `` **want to show the \`\` in the code, so we have to \`\`\`to warp codes **
    >
    > 3. ``Use `code` in your.``  ***same as above***
    >
    > 4. directly show \`words\` ,not in the code. we can simply use backslash to escape.

+ ***multi-lines codes***

  - use \`\`\` codes\`\`\`. 

    > ```html
    > <html>
    >   <head>
    >     <title></title>
    >   </head>
    >   <body>
    >     This is dope.
    >   </body>
    > </html>
    > ```

    **you can choose the programming languaging using the code in the: :arrow_upper_right:**

### Horizontal rules

+ Easy, just use three or more than three  " -", then we can get one horizontal rules:

  > \---

  ---

  ---

  ---

### Links

+  My website is **\[name](https, links)**

+ the brackets follows immediately with the paratheses, ***no spaces***

  > [GOOGLE](WWW.google.com.au)

+ you can add a "words" after the parentheses with no spaces, to shows some tips when people hovers the links.

  > \[haha](www.hha.com"this is a fake website")

+ If you want to direct show the (haha), you can use < > directly.

  > <www.baidu.com>
  >
  > :+1:  : \<good.com>
  >
  > :-1::   [](good.com​)

+ ***formatting links***

  > - for compatibility, **the links cannot include any spaces**
  >
  > - if you want add the effect of bold or italic to the link, we can do:
  >
  >   > \**\[name](links)\**
  >   >
  >   > \*\*\[name](links)\*\*
  >   >
  >   > \*\*\*\[name](links)\*\*\*
  >
  > - as well as \``in the \[name]:
  >
  >   > [\``jaja\``] to let the jaja looks like a code: [``jaja``]

### Images

+ follow these rules: **\!\[name]\(links.jpg"maybe some descriptions")**

  > or just drag the image into typora, i think it should work.

### Tables

+ i cant believe anyone will do this in Markdown

+ | Tables        |      Are      |  Cool |
  | ------------- | :-----------: | ----: |
  | col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
  | col 2 is      |   centered    |   $12 |
  | zebra stripes |   are neat    |    $1 |

# Important notes

## Use Backslash to escaping characters

+ | Character |                             Name                             |
  | --------- | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
  | \         |                          backslash                           |
  | `         | backtick (see also [escaping backticks in code](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#escaping-backticks)) |
  | *         |                           asterisk                           |
  | _         |                          underscore                          |
  | { }       |                         curly braces                         |
  | [ ]       |                           brackets                           |
  | ( )       |                         parentheses                          |
  | #         |                          pound sign                          |
  | +         |                          plus sign                           |
  | -         |                     minus sign (hyphen)                      |
  | .         |                             dot                              |
  | !         |                       exclamation mark                       |
  | \|        | pipe (see also [escaping pipe in tables](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#escaping-pipe-characters-in-tables)) |

## Mistakes and Techniques

1. use ***alt + left-arrow*** to skip over the whole word, if you use **left-arrow***,  it moves as a single letter.

2. use \<br>   and  \\ to enter a new line

3. emoji syntax =  :something:

   > go for this link: [emoji collection](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908"tasty")

4. ***Contionous updating***
